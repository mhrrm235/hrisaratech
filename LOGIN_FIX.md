# Admin Login Fix - December 4, 2025

## Problem
User `admin@example.com` was not found in the database and couldn't login with `Password123!`

## Root Cause
The `CreateAdminUserSeeder` and `UpdateAdminToPowerUserSeeder` were not being executed during database seeding because they were not called in `DatabaseSeeder.php`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated DatabaseSeeder
Added calls to:
```php
$this->call(\Database\Seeders\CreateAdminUserSeeder::class);
$this->call(\Database\Seeders\UpdateAdminToPowerUserSeeder::class);
```

### 2. Fixed Admin Password
Changed password in `CreateAdminUserSeeder` from `password123` to `Password123!` (with capital P and exclamation mark)

### 3. Reset Database
Ran `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` to apply all fixes

## Result ✓
Admin user now exists with correct credentials:
- **Email**: admin@example.com  
- **Password**: Password123! (verified working ✓)
- **Role**: Power User (access to all features)
- **Employee**: System Administrator

## Verification
Password verification confirmed:
```
User found: admin@example.com
Password hash: $2y$12$BVHJSTLmSwrWiH8xOQstheXOajEbScax1uL5b01r/EDYrH0Zj1lhW
