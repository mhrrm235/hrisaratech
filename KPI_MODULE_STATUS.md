   - Department Avg Task Completion

6. **Behavior Metrics** (4 metrics)
   - Compliance Score: 100 - (incidents × 10)
   - Document Signing Speed: Average hours
   - Signature Verification Rate: Verified / Total × 100%
   - Conduct Score: 100 - severity_points

7. **Quality Metrics** (2 metrics - placeholder for future)
   - Task Quality Score (1-5)
   - Efficiency Index

#### Composite Score Calculation ✓
- Weighted average of key metrics:
  - Attendance Rate: 25%
  - Task Completion Rate: 35%
  - Compliance Score: 15%
  - Task Quality Score: 15%
  - Conduct Score: 10%

#### Performance Level Classification ✓
- Excellent: 90-100
- Good: 75-89
- Satisfactory: 60-74
- Needs Improvement: 45-59
- Unsatisfactory: <45

### Phase 3: KPI Seeder (COMPLETE)

#### Master KPI Data ✓
Created 9 predefined KPI records across categories with:
- Unique codes (ATT_RATE, TASK_COMP_RATE, etc.)
- Target values and ranges
- Weights for composite scoring
- Descriptions and formulas

#### Employee KPI Records Generation ✓
- Calculates KPIs for all employees in current period
- Stores snapshots in employee_kpi_records table
- Generates composite scores
- Assigns performance levels

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Phase

### To Add Dashboard Menu:
Update `resources/views/layouts/dashboard.blade.php` sidebar with:
```blade
<li><a href="{{ route('kpi.dashboard') }}">KPI & Reports</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ route('kpi.individual') }}">My KPI</a></li>
  <li><a href="{{ route('reports.recap') }}">Monthly Recap</a></li>
```

### To Create KPI Controller:
```bash
php artisan make:controller KPIController
php artisan make:controller ReportingController
```

### To Add Routes:
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:Employee,Manager,HR,Power User'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/kpi', [KPIController::class, 'index'])->name('kpi.index');
    Route::get('/kpi/{id}', [KPIController::class, 'show'])->name('kpi.show');
    Route::get('/reports/recap', [ReportingController::class, 'recap'])->name('reports.recap');
    Route::get('/reports/{id}/export', [ReportingController::class, 'export'])->name('reports.export');
});
```
