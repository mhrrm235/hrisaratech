# KPI & Reporting Module Documentation

## Overview
The KPI & Reporting Module is a comprehensive performance management system that tracks, calculates, and reports on employee Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) across 7 categories with 26+ individual metrics.

## Module Components

### 1. Database Layer

#### Tables
- **kpis**: Master KPI definitions with categories, formulas, targets, and weights
- **employee_kpi_records**: Monthly/periodic KPI snapshots for each employee
- **performance_reviews**: Qualitative reviews paired with KPI data
- **incidents**: Behavioral incidents and compliance tracking

#### Relationships
- Employee → Many EmployeeKPIRecords
- Employee → Many PerformanceReviews  
- Employee → Many Incidents

## Data Entry & Calculation

### Automatic Calculation
KPI values are calculated from:
- **Attendance**: Presence records (check-in/out times)
- **Productivity**: Task statuses and completion dates
- **Leave**: Approved leave requests
- **Salary**: Employee payroll data
- **Department**: Aggregated from employee metrics
- **Behavior**: Incidents and digital signatures
- **Quality**: Task completion quality metrics

### Manual Adjustment
HR can manually recalculate KPIs via `/kpi/recalculate/{id}` endpoint.

## Seeders

### KPISeeder
Seeds 26 master KPI definitions across 7 categories:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=KPISeeder
```

### EmployeeKPIRecordsSeeder
Generates realistic KPI records for all employees (current + 2 previous months):
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=EmployeeKPIRecordsSeeder
```

**Features:**
- Realistic distribution (70% achievement, 20% warning, 10% critical)
- Category-specific calculation algorithms

## Customization

### Adding New KPI Categories
1. Create new KPI records in database
2. Add calculation method to KPICalculationService
3. Update weight formula in calculateCompositeScore()
4. Update seeder with new metrics

### Modifying Weight Formula
Edit `KPICalculationService::calculateCompositeScore()` method to adjust category weights.

### Changing Performance Levels
Edit `KPICalculationService::getPerformanceLevel()` method to adjust score thresholds.

### Customizing Views
All views use Bootstrap and Font Awesome. Edit individual view files to customize styling.

## Maintenance

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on: employee_id, period, created_at
- Unique constraint on: (employee_id, kpi_id, period)

### Caching
Consider implementing caching for:
- Executive dashboard aggregations
- Department-wide statistics
- Historical trend calculations

### Archival
Implement periodic archival for old KPI records to maintain performance.

## Troubleshooting

### KPI Records Not Showing
1. Verify presence/task/leave records exist
2. Run seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=EmployeeKPIRecordsSeeder`
3. Check employee-user relationship
4. Verify period format (YYYY-MM)

### Dashboard Not Loading
1. Clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
2. Verify user has employee record
3. Check authorization middleware
4. Review logs for errors

### Export Issues
1. Verify Barryvdh\DomPDF is installed
2. Check file permissions for export directory
3. Ensure sufficient server memory for large exports

## Performance Considerations

- KPI calculations are on-demand (not cached by default)
- Large exports may require increased PHP memory
- Consider pagination for executive dashboard
- Pre-calculate monthly snapshots during off-peak hours

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Advanced analytics with ML predictions
- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] Goal-setting module with KPI alignment
- [ ] Performance improvement plan tracking
